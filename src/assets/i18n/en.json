      "INTRO-TEXT2": "In a small alley in the town of Qalamoun, where the scent of burnt copper fills the air and the sound of hammers striking metal plates echoes, Salim Abdel Mahid Hassoun was born in 1947, surrounded by the gleaming copper pieces crafted with precision by his father. From an early age, Salim found himself immersed in a family tradition deeply rooted in craftsmanship, as his father was one of the most skilled artisans renowned for his work in copper engraving.",

      "INFO1-TEXT": "As a child, Salim would watch in awe as his father's hands transformed solid copper sheets into living masterpieces. It wasn't just a profession—it was a family legacy that embodied history and culture. Despite the difficulty of the work, Salim didn’t hesitate to pick up the hammer and learn the secrets of the craft, eventually becoming one of Lebanon's most prominent copper artisans.",
      "INFO2": "The Eastern Gallery",
      "INFO2-TEXT1": "He established his own workshop under the name 'The Eastern Gallery', which soon became a destination for lovers of oriental art and unique copper pieces. There, he excelled in designing lamps, decorative trays, and artistic sculptures that adorned homes and palaces.",
      "INFO2-TEXT2": "Salim faced many challenges as the number of artisans dwindled, and the demand for handmade products decreased with the rise of modern industry. However, he remained committed to preserving this legacy, determined to pass it on to future generations. He believed that every piece he created told a story, and every engraving carried the spirit of history.",
      "INFO3": "The Old Souk: A Living Legacy",
      "INFO3-TEXT1": "After his passing, the glow of copper did not fade from his family. His children decided to continue the journey and revive the craft under the name 'The Old Souk', preserving the authenticity of the past with the spirit of the present.",
      "INFO3-TEXT2": "Thus, the legacy of Salim Hassoun remains eternal, not only in the copper pieces he crafted but in the hearts that carried his passion and the hands that continued to strike the copper, ensuring that this ancient art would never fade away.",
